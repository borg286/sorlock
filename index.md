Guide for Multi-threat Sorlocks

# Introduction

======

You likely know about the [Coffeelock](https://forums.giantitp.com/showthread.php?542964-Can-someone-please-explain-the-%91coffeelock%92-to-me). Xanathar's Guide to Everything gave us the Hexblade and Divine Soul.

This multiclass opens for many amazing builds like

* [THE NAMELESS KING](https://www.enworld.org/threads/optimization-the-nameless-king-the-wizards-nightmare-last-boss.602665/)

* [The Tormented Divine Soul](https://www.enworld.org/threads/guide-the-sorlock-%E2%80%93-guide-to-the-tormented-divine-soul-with-xanathars-divine-soul-17-hexblade-3.596310/)

This build aims to go beyond a Jack of all trades, and be capable of filling a laundry list of jobs and shining in 4 major in and out of combat roles. Use as a base to fill in any role the team is missing.

# Know your Roles

======

Building off of [Treantmonk's God wizard’s guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IeOXWvbkmQ3nEyM2P3lS8TU4rsK6QJP0oH7HE_v67QY/edit) I start off with the roles. I’ll later dive deeper into analysis of each role and how to approach them using a Sorlock.

## In Combat

### Methods vs Roles of combat

D&D grew up on 4 main stereotypical classes that developed into their own roles: The fighting-man, the magic-user, the thief, and the cleric. We've come a long way since then but people generally approach combat primarily in one or two of these ways:

* Ranged Single Attacks

* AoE damage

* Support/Buff

* Battlefield Control

* Melee

* Being sticky and/or drawing fire

### BSF vs. Defender

Both Defenders and Big Stupid Fighters will rush into the fray.

A Big Stupid Fighter tries to force the BBEG and mooks to hit him instead of his allies, drawing their fire away. His HP needs to be patched up after every fight if not healed from dropping to 0.

A Defender, however, is a specialized battlefield controller, expert in forcing a catch-22: Attack him with little impact, or try and attack others at great cost.

### Glass Cannon vs. Striker

Both Glass Cannons and Strikers know how to nova and delete the largest threat.

A Glass Cannon has maximized damage without minimizing their weak points.

A Striker recognizes diminishing returns, how to delete and stay alive to tell the tale.

### Healbot vs. Leader

Both the Healbot and Leader keep the team alive often helping on the front lines.

The Healbot wastes his actions and spells unsuccessfully compensating for damage dealt.

The Leader wields his troops, sharpens them with buffs, creates openings, widens weaknesses, and deals with damage at appropriate times.

### Blaster vs. Battlefield Controller

Both the Blaster and Battlefield Controller have tricks to deal with a horde of mooks.

The Blaster has 101 ways of blasting, but are frustrated when total HP isn't spread into ½ CR chunks or allies are in the way.

The Battlefield Controller masters his spell list to frustrate the DMs plans and alter reality until he sees victory.

## Out of Combat

### Face

Almost every class has one social skill available. Enchantment spells help. Creativity can also be channeled through Illusion.

### Scout

Some want to scout the enemy numbers, find ambushes, and deal with the traps. Be careful or you turn into a corpse instead.

### Healbot

Bottom line is in-combat healing can't keep up with monster damage. You only get ½ of your Hit Dice after a long rest. 2 feats exist to nearly double the healing on those long days: Inspiring Leader and Healer.

The other thing healers do out of combat is healing status effects like poisoned, disease, HP drained and even death.

### Utility

Transport, Divining, Illusions, Invisibility, Flight. With as few known spells as you have, you'll want to choose carefully, but thankfully we’ll have both the sorcerer and cleric spell list to cherry pick from. With as much overlap between Wizard - Sorcerer - Bard - Cleric, you are likely to have these bases covered. This will lift the burden from the other caster from needing to have so many utility spells prepared.

# Build versatility

======

Unlike the Wizard/Cleric/Bard/Druid you can reshuffle lower level slots through Spell Points and create slots that your party needs.  You can Quicken and blow your top level slots in a nova, then rebalance your slots and do it again.

The core Coffeelock mechanic is to convert your short rest refreshing spell slots into persistent spell points, then again convert those into slots you need. Like the Psion of 3rd edition, you can think in terms of points to spend in the day, then keep the Sorcery Point Pool topped up for when you need to go nova. It only costs a bonus action to create the spell slot you need in the moment.

This guide is intended to show how a Divine Sorlock can be made to fill in all the roles a team needs, then use the selections below, which your team already covers, and use them for doing better at jobs you like.

# The Action economy

======

## Baseline

Characters normally only get 1 action, an bonus action, a reaction, and a move. Powerful spells and most long running spells require one's concentration. Normally the caster can cast a single spell on their turn only maintain a single concentration spell for the encounter and are balanced with this in mind.

## Quicken

A 3rd level Sorcerer gets 2 Metamagic options. Quicken lets you spend 2 spell points to cast a spell as a bonus action. Note that the main action can't be used to cast another spell, except for a Cantrip. Thankfully Sorlocks dip Warlock for the amazing Eldritch Blast and Booming Blade. But the real benefit is to frontload actions at the beginning of battle, effectively letting you strike/defend and control in the same round.

## Levitate

Normally a creature gets a save every round to shrug off the effects of a spell, gains advantage when damaged, or breaks free entirely. Levitate only has 1 save and you can keep the target aloft for 10 minutes, long enough for most any ranged attack to use them as a clay pigeon on easy mode.  

The drawback is that (1) a Huge creature easily weighs more than the **500 lb limit**, (2) a low ceiling lets them climb down, and (3) **ineffective/helpful on casters/archers**.  But when the target fails, as long as you keep your concentration, you've single handedly removed them from the fight.

Cast on an ally lets you lift them out of danger.

### Uber Levitate

**Levitating 2 squishies**

Given that most parties have 1-2 frontline fighters and 1-2 squishies, lifting both squishies frees the defender from the worry of taking care of them. This lasts 10 minutes, long enough to last a few adjacent encounters, when you need to stretch your slots.

**Levitating 2 heavy hitters**

Levitate targets Con, which is often high, especially in monsters that lack a ranged attack. Having 2 chances means you're likely to accomplish something.

## Greater Invisibility

*A note about attacking while invisible: When you attack you give away your location, but remain unseen. Attackers don't have to guess the square you attacked from, they’d just have disadvantage attacking you if you’re still there. Best to move after you attack, and high tail it if they smart up and ready an attack.*

Here are some great ways to use Greater Invisibility

* Turn the rogue into a defender with a mean bite if a foe provokes an opportunity attack while stuck in the open

* Combine with Booming Blade and Warcaster to lock foes down. Your Booming Blade's extra damage averages out to the same as sneak attack.  Only tell your fellow player where you are to keep the DM hesitant on moving guys around.

* Combine Warcaster, Whip, Eldritch Blast and Repelling Blast to protect the squishies when foes move past you to the squishies or simply be in the middle of the battlefield. Sadly Booming Blade won't work with a Whip.

* Cast on 2 squishies who absolutely need their concentration this encounter

## Haste

Not only is this a multithread spell but the synergy of 2 targets, say a fighter and rogue quickly getting into position, is great.

* Striker: The rogue will love another chance to ensure Sneak Attack is done. If anyone on the team is using a Greatsword, then you inherit the extra DPR.

* Buff: This is the definition of buff.

* Healer: +2 AC and advantage on Dex saves like fireball mean less healing. Be careful with fighters that already have a high AC as it may unbalance their catch-22 (impossible to hit = more attacks on you).

## Polymorph

Often this is used to turn someone into a T-Rex (Huge). A Sorcerer gets 2, which can wall off a battlefield rather than just make an avoidable danger zone. T-Rexes average 53 damage per round. Careful as the fighter likely deals more damage, so check beforehand. Casters would accept if they don't want to blow a slot that needs concentration; the T-Rex has horrible AC.

This also doubles as a preemptive and reactive healing spell. You preemptively give someone 136 temp HP. You can also reactively "heal" someone that's nearly dead, turning them into a threat rather than a risk.

# Damage lens

======

## Strikers, DPR and KPR

### DPR

DPR (Damage Per Round) is a way of estimating one's damage given there is only a chance to hit/fail a save.

DPR = Chance to hit * Damage on a hit

Chance to hit = 1 - (AC - 1 - to hit bonus)/20

Damage on a hit = (min roll + max roll)/2 + bonuses

For example, if I have a +5 to hit an AC of 13 with 2d6+3 greatsword then 

DPR = (1-(13-5-1)/20) * (2(1+6)/2 + 3)

DPR = (1-7/20) * (2*3.5 + 3)

DPR = 65% * 10 = 6.5 DPR

#### Advantage

Having advantage makes the chance to hit = 100% - not hitting both times = 1-((AC - to hit)/20)^2

Elven Accuracy can be approximated with 100% - not hitting three times = 1-((AC - to hit)/20)^3

#### Example

Ok, so let's say I’m level 10, how do I calculate my DPR if I don’t know what I’m hitting?  Here is where we introduce our first simplification:

monster AC = CR/3 + 12

This assumes you're going toe-to-toe with a monster with CR = your level. Since everyone is doing this we’re on equal footing.

### KPR

If we not only assume a "standard" AC, but a “standard” HP for our appropriately leveled monster, then we can calculate the percent of his life we think we expect to deal each round. We call this Kills Per Round. Because it is a percentage of his life we can compare both low level and high level characters on the same ruler.

A KPR of 0.25 means you can expect to chew through 25% of a typical monster's HP for your level each round and is a baseline for strikers.

0.3 < KPR < 0.5

0.5 < KPR < 1.0

KPR > 1.0 is usually because you are doing a Nova AOE but positioning and resources rarely let you do this every round. When looking at spike damage you want this above 1.0 to either clear out lots of mooks or to take down the BBEG.

KPR = DPR / (14*CR +10)

## Casters and spell slots

Casters have daily spell slots (except warlock). Sorcerers can use Font of Magic to reshuffle these resources and spend them on the most efficient spells for the job. While we can't calculate efficiency of utility and battlefield control spells, we can analyze blast spells and limit spells known to only the most efficient.

### Damage per Spell Slot

Expand this list to see why we only have a couple damage spells. We pick the best bang for the buck, 1 for single target, another for AoE.

* Ray of Sickness: 2d8 @60% to fail costing 2 spell points = 9*.6/2 = 2.7 DpSP (damage per spell point),9*0.6/(14*1+10) 0.14 KPR, 9*0.6=5.4 expected damage

* Paladin Smite: 2d8 @ 100%(smite on hit) costing 2 spell points = 4.5 DpSP, +0.25 KPR, +9 dam

* Burning Hands (2.25 targets): 2.25 targets * 3d6 @60% to fail costing 2 spell points = 9.1 DpSP, .48 KPR, 19 dam

* Burning Hands with Dragon Soul (2.25 targets): 2.25 targets * 3d6 +3 @60% to fail costing 2 spell points = 12.2 DpSP, 0.61 KPR, 24.3 dam

* Twin Firebolt: 2d10 @ 60% to hit costing 1 spell point = 10 DpSP, 0.56 KPR, 12.3 dam

* Twin Eldritch Blast: 2d10@ 60% to hit costing 1 spell point = 6 DpSP, 0.56 KPR, 12.3 dam

* Scorching Ray: 3*2d6 @ 60% to hit costing 3 spell point (2nd level slot) =6.2 DpSP, 0.32 KPR, 18.6 dam

* Quickened Eldritch Blast(@5th) + Eldritch Blast + Agonizing Blast(AG): 6d6+2d10+2*cha @60% costing 5 Spell points = 16.7 DpSP, 0.42 KPR, 33 dam

* Fireball(4 targets): 8d6@60% fail costing 5 SP = 17.1 DpSP, 1.28 KPR, 16.8 dam/target

* Twinned Blight: 16d8 @60% fail costing 10 SP = 4.3 DpSP, 0.4 KPR, 21 dam/target

* Quickened Scorching Ray + EB + AB + Hex + curse: 10d6 + 2d10+2*cha + 7*Prof + 7d6 @ 60% to hit costing 10 SP = 7.2 DpSP, 0.66 KPR, 72 dam single target

* Quickened Eldritch Blast(@11th level) + Eldritch Blast + AB: 6d10@ 60% to hit costing 2 SP = 27.7 DpSP, 0.36 KPR, 55 dam single target

* Disintegrate: 10d6+40@60% to fail costing 9 points = 5 DpSP, 0.3 KPR, 45 dam

* Twin Disintegrate: 20d6+80@60% to fail costing 15 points = 6 DpSP, 0.6 KPR, 90 dam

* Quickened Chain Lightning + EB + AB: 4(10d8)+2d10+2*cha@ 60% to hit costing 11 points = 15.6 DpSP, 1.13 KPR, 171 dam tot

* Quickened Chain Lightning(7th level slot) + EB + AB: 5(10d8)+2d10+2*cha@ 60% to hit costing 13 points = 16 DpSP, 1.17 KPR, 207 dam tot

* Finger of Death: 7d8+30@60% to fail costing 11 points = 5 DpSP, 0.32 KPR, 57 dam

* Twinned Finger of Death: 14d8+60@60% to fail costing 18 points = 4.8 DpSP, 0.48 KPR, 86 dam

* Quickened Eldritch Blast(17th level) + Eldritch Blast + AB + curse w/ advantage: 8d10+8*5+8*6 @88% to hit = 58 DpSP, 0.43 KPR, 116 dam

### Thoughts on examples

We see that Eldritch blast at 5th level (Sorcerer 3/Warlock 2) rocks 16.7 DpSP meaning that at level 5 and 5 encounters and 5 rounds each you could theoretically deal = 802 damage total.  Amazing longevity, but we need to couple this with options that front load damage (high KPR) especially at the levels just prior to 5, 11, 17.

Fireball shines as wonderfully in both the DpSP and KPR arenas.  It scales absolutely horribly, so we need to find something with high KPR till we get Chain Lightning, which scales the best of all spells +10d8 / slot.  Vitriolic Sphere(17 DpSP, 1.1 KPR) and Cone of Cold(16 DpSP, 1.1 KPR)  are the best candidates but are AoE rather than single target.  To get near those numbers for single-target we have to do an upleveled Scorching Ray with Hexblade's curse and Warlock’s Hex. This gives us a respectable 0.66 KPR at the cost of a mediocre 7.2 DpSP.

If we imagine a sorcerer somehow capable of casting Twinned Finger of Death every round (86 damage) it is worse than a bit of preparation(hex+curse) and using the Eldritch Blast cantrip (116 dam) which can be focused or spread out. This shows me that Hexblade + quicken checks off the striker role for almost all levels.

The Sorlock can rely on **Eldritch Blast for Single Target** past level 5, and follow this progression for AoE

**Dragon's Breath -> Fireball -> Synaptic Static -> Chain Lightning**

Feel free to skip over 2 of these if you're starving for spell swaps.

## Buffers

Can we convert Bless into added KPR? Yes. If you know the stats for the melee/ranged characters in your group calculate KPR before and after Bless. This is your KPR. Do the same for Haste and Advantage from Greater Invisibility. Command is even a DPR spell as they provoke Opportunity Attacks when Fleeing.

If we assume 2 targets are using attacks we get the following

* Bless: +2.5 to hit means 0.125/0.6 * Original KPR = added KPR / target

* Haste/Command(Flee): Calculate single attack DPR / HP = added KPR / target

* Invisibility: Advantage (60% -> 84%) means 0.24 / .6 * Original KPR = added KPR / target

## Dangers with Darkness

A common strategy with Sorlocks is to cast Darkness yet have Devil's sight. This will indeed give them protection and advantage for the cheap price of 2-3 spell points and their concentration. Sadly the drawbacks aren’t discussed.

* Casting it on yourself and rushing into melee blinds both foe and ally alike. Not fun for anyone but you.

* Casting it and hiding in a corner makes that corner a prime target for AoEs.

* Monsters will likely start having true sight earlier than expected.

* Your concentration slot could be used for so many other things. 

Lift yourself from the shackles of the extra DPR you do with advantage, and imagine the extra DPR you could do through others.

# Defender: Focused Controller

======

5th edition has opened the doors of the defender role to anyone with an attack, then lets you combine elements to suit your style rather than forcing some opinion.

## Tools to be a defender

* Opportunity attacks let you be sticky enabling a frontline fighter to literally hold the line

* [Optional DM rule] [Mark](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#action%20options_dmg): As part of an attack you can mark a foe. Opportunity attacks are made with advantage and your Reaction isn't spent but are still limited to one Opportunity Attack per turn.

    * This somewhat breaks the action economy but enables a defender to incentivise engaged foes to stay put.

* [Sentinel feat:](http://dnd5ed.wikidot.com/feat:sentinel) If you hit with your opportunity attack they have to stay put. Disengaging doesn't work. Attacking another ally lets you react with an attack

* High AC/Shrugging off damage: To provide proper catch-22s the monster must pick between high risk-high reward or low risk-low reward. Risk eating an opportunity attack but get a swipe at the squishies, or try to hit the tank (high AC or can mitigate damage easily).

## Challenges

* Ranged attacks (Eldritch blast) suffer disadvantage when next to a hostile creature that can see you

* At high levels a single melee attack becomes a small tax to pay to get away from the defender and squish the squishies.  Defenders must either have a nastier bite (eg. Sneak Attack), or have hard control (eg. Sentinel).

* You have a single Reaction action. Once spent there is no risk waltzing away from you.

* If your AC is impossibly high the monster may find attacking a squishy worth eating an opportunity attack

## How a Sorlock defends

* Greater Invisibility lets you do the following

    * Eldritch Blast with advantage as monsters, even adjacent ones, can't see you

    * See below for using Warcaster

    * Wield a Whip and use Eldritch Blast instead of Booming Blade so your opportunity attacks cover a larger area. Placing yourself between enemies and a squishy so when a monastery passes by you they provoke before getting to your friend. Repelling Blast can push them so far out they lose a turn.

* Twin Booming Blade to lock down 2 goes. Quicken a third Booming Blade

    * Combine with Quicken Eldritch Blast to push them away from attacking you yet still worried about moving.

* Warcaster lets you attack with Booming Blade, sheathing them in the field. Up to the DM if the creature can cancel their move.  The Sentinel feat implies the secondary damage will always get triggered. If the DM agrees then switch to the next approach.

    * Comparing the extra damage from Booming Blade to Sneak Attack one finds they average to the same over 1-20 levels.

* Twin Levitate to simply pull squishies out of harms way.

* Repelling Blast lets each Eldritch Blast ray push 10', potentially freeing up an ally to move and attack.

* Suggestion on the BBEG to command all his troops to pull off the squishies and dogpile the tank. If the tank fails to hold the line, convince someone in authority to control his army the way you want.

* Command the BBEG to "Regroup" to similar effects.

* Be on the lookout for a +1/+2/+3 Shield (no attunement).

* Tank damage with Absorb Elements. Recall it lasts a whole round and works on Bludgeoning, Slashing and so forth, not just elemental damage.

* Arms of Hadar: Large 25'x25’ area. A failed save means no Opportunity Attacks, making it easier to regroup the team.

* [Optional] Staff of the Python: Huge size + 10' reach = more frontline controlled. The Constrict attack (usable as opportunity attack at 5’) bestows the Grappled condition on hit, no contest.  It takes an action to free oneself from an OK DC, but an action spent is an attack not made.

* Sleet Storm to keep foes coming at a trickle rather than a wave.

* Creating chokepoints

    * Coordinating with other casters to duplicate their battlefield control spells with Silent Image and create chokepoints. Eg. grease, web, flaming sphere

    * Minor Illusion(Maximillian's earthen grasp) to steer foes into chokepoint. Recall no concentration.

Some drawbacks if you end up needing to fill this role

### Either Strike or Defend

Because you have disadvantage on ranged attacks, unless you are invisible, you are sacrificing your ability to Eldritch Blast a foe for being a Defender. The only way to get out of it is by forcing Booming Blade and hoping it kills them before they get an attack on those you are defending.

### Maintaining Concentration

Each hit results in damage, which is a concentration save (DC = max(10, damage/2)).  This is one of the few times that bonuses scaled for damage and HP cross into the the bounded accuracy system (AC, Saves..) where those bonuses wreak havoc.  1/2ing helps but at high levels a few monsters can give you impossibly high DCs. Warcaster gives you Advantage which you desperately need for the majority of attacks. The table below shows your chances of making various DCs with advantage.

Be on the watchout for heavy hitters that deal their damage in 1 attack. You have a fair chance of handling 2 hard hits, but no chance of making a single super heavy hit.

For these reasons we stack multiple layers to not get hit, and reduce the damage when hit.

* Shield: It does cost your Reaction and threat of an opportunity attack, but you've succeeded in them targeting you instead of your ally.  On the upside, +5 AC for the rest of the round makes you nigh impossible to hit.

* Counterspell: Spells bypass your DC, so stop the fireball before it happens.

* Mirror Image: Don't use these against a horde or an artillery of archers as each hit chews through the supply of 3 images.  But it is great against spellcasters as a fear/charm effect might target them and be ignored yet not pop the image unless the spell deals damage.

* Warcaster: Advantage on concentration saves is amazing

* Sorcerer's Proficiency in Constitution as advantage can only take you so far when a really heavy hitter shows up.

* Absorb Elements: This doesn't need to be used against an elemental attack. Any incoming damage can be halved. When facing mooks that use the same weapon, you can half each damage roll.

* Favored by the Gods: once per short rest. No reaction so it can be used with Shield/Absorb Elements. Also can be used when you find you just barely missed the DC.

* Yuan-ti has immunity to Poison, the 2nd most common element of damage monsters deal.

* Yuan-ti has magic resistance: Magic spells/effects deal lots of damage once. While you may not be able to concentrate if you fail, you want those fails to be rare.

* [Optional] Adamantine armor: Most monster damage is in the damage roll, not static bonuses. Crits can kill your concentration.

# Healing wisely

======

1. Contribute to the Battle proactively

2. Prevent Death by reviving fallen allies

3. Aid in recovery after battles by offsetting damage

## Contribute to the Battle Proactively

You're not a Life Cleric and can’t keep everyone topped up. Monster damage just out paces anyone’s healing potential.  Instead focus on ending the battle sooner so monsters deal less damage in the first place.

Focus on offense, and if that fails fall back on Healing Word. Plan on succeeding with the minimal failsafe possible to catch you if you fall. More specifically, only allocate 1-2 spells known on HP healing, Healing word and Raise Dead/Resurrection.

## Aid in recovery after battles by offsetting damage

#### Inspiring Leader

If your days are short then one's max HP determines when they must tap out. Temp HP can therefore be likened to extra Con, a hair above +2 Con to be precise. As it's free HP, this gives people incentive to be more risky.

#### Healer

Similar to Inspiring leader as it offsets more damage the more short rests you have. This one is like having 3-4 extra hit dice.  If there is already someone on the team with one of these feats you can easily take the other. The spell slots are likely the first to be spent before the hit dice.

## Preventing death by reviving fallen allies

### In combat

It is a trap trying to heal damage monsters do during combat. Heal spells simply don't do enough, and you don’t have the slots and actions. Unless there is a life cleric in your group don’t expect anyone to get topped up.

* Healing Word: Cleric, Bard and Druid and you get this spell. Bonus action mostly used when someone goes down. 0 HP is the lowest you can go. All damage taken past this doesn't need to be healed. The hardest part is convincing others that you got their back and to throw caution to the wind.

* Polymorph: For the cost of a 4th level spell you not only can save someone dangerously low on HP, and likely not concentrating on anything, into a giant T-Rex with 136 temp HP.

* Aid: The boost in HP max stacks with Inspiring Leader. Healer now has a higher level to heal to.

* Revivify: Don't get this. Your spells known are stretched thin as it is. Plan for success. Twin Healing word/Polymorph if there is a TPK imminent.

* Cure Wounds/Mass Cure Wounds: Don't ever select these spells. You don’t want to top people up. Ofsetting HP damage is best done with Healer/Inspiring Leader

* Summons: While you don't get good summons like the Druid does, if you can get a Staff of Python (uncommon) this is better in most ways.  You can keep the Giant Constricting Snake (size:Huge) around after a fight and into the next, so it benefits from Inspiring Leader. This boosts its HP from 60 -> 64 HP - 82 HP. A minor action reverts it back to a staff and resets all damage. Just redeploy. Do this rarely so your DM doesn’t focus on killing it.

### Death comes to all

Raise Dead: If you have a Bard or Cleric try to get them to prepare this instead of you, but you can if needs be.

#### Preemptive Healing with Battlefield Control

* Command, Levitate, Sleet Storm are pure control spells, but they do prevent damage before they happen. This kind of preemptive healing often goes unnoticed.

* Summons like Staff of the Python and Animate Objects can take damage you ignore.

## Removing Conditions

Lesser/Greater Restoration are beautiful in a Sorcerer's hands as they can be twinned. The nasty effects are often imposed on the party as a whole. Double the turnaround time with Twin.

If there is a Paladin in the party immediately drop these known spells despite his Lay on Hands being slightly weaker. Your known spell slots are spread thin as it is.

## Illusions

Primary reading: [The Illusionists Guide to Reality](https://www.enworld.org/threads/the-illusionists-guide-to-reality.652620/)

To help the DM, add the intent and your justification for why the viewers would likely react.

"I am creating this acid pit to create a chokepoint. This should work because we are in combat and the monsters are too busy to investigate the illusion."

### Illusions have no save!?!?

Unlike spells that have the target make a save, the monsters must either see the illusion break, or take an action to do an Investigation check using their Intelligence, a common Dump Stat. Thus you get a high score and Proficiency, and potentially Hex debuffing them, and they only get a dump stat's modifier. You only get better as you level.

### Why a pool of lava/crate isn't a good idea

The closer to reality you are the more believable it is. There is no "summon lava" spell, especially at low levels. Imitate Mold Earth instead, inform the DM that the foes see the earth spring up with a head poking out the top and keep your DM guessing which spell you used.

The crate in the middle of the battlefield seems out of place, and odd to appear mid-battle.

### Minor Illusion in combat

* Ally casts real grease/entangle. Mimic sound of monsters calling it an illusion.

* Maximillian's earthen grasp protects 15' square

* Flaming Sphere protects 15' square

* Fake Mold Earth's mound of dirt, make the DM second guess your cantrips.

* Fake BBEG's voice, "Fall Back!!", see Peter Pan quoting Hook, to group them for AoE.

* "Fireball Incoming!!!"

* "Encircle the master!!" Preparing for some AoE

* Guardian of Faith

### Silent Image imitating spells

* Silent Image: Arms of Hadar/Evard's Black Tentacles

* Silent Image: Entangle

* Silent Image: Grease

### Minor Illusion out of combat

* Image of the Macguffin you are trying to retrieve, then distract and take the real one

* Distract guards with sounds of a fight

* Pile of gold to lure goblins out

* Dead Termites covering a rotten bridge on a rope bridge

* Make a wanted poster of town villain

## Controlling choices

### Suggestion

* I suggest you surrender to save your life.

* Your buddy there has been planning to let you die and take your stuff. You better throw him under the bus before he throws you.

### Command in combat

* Betray/Revolt/Defect/Desert/Coup

* Regroup

* Burp/Belch (on a dragon)

* Fall/Trip

* Flee/Sprint/Dash

* Cower

* Dismiss/Abort/Cancel/Juggle (lose concentration, spells specify 'Dismiss' as an option)

* Undress/Strip (includes dropping weapon, shield, belt w/ component pouch, refrain from running)

* Approach

* Stop/Drop(See Undress instead)

* Grovel

* Halt

* Blaspheme/Apostatize (on a paladin/cleric)

* Tantrum

* Charge

### Command out of combat

 (Note, the target doesn't have to hear you, nor are you charming them.) (Also note, these are transitive verbs in case you want to find others. Here is a big list)

* Commands above

* Monologue/Sing

* Defecate

* Dance/Salsa/Tango/Spin/Frolic/Prance

* Confess(bypass zone of truth, DM may confess squat)

* Cooperate/Capitulate

* Scream

* Pardon

* Believe

* Relent

* Cheat

* Eat/Drink (after poisoning their food)

* Overpay/Undercharge

# Feats

======

* Inspiring Leader: As mentioned in the Healer section, this shines if your team has short days. Max HP matters more than Hit Dice in those cases. This is equivalent to +2 con for the party.

* Healer: Can heal more overall HP than Inspiring Leader, but does so reactively. Depending on the number of short rests this is equivalent to an extra +3-5 extra Hit Dice on long days.

* Warcaster: Combine with Greater Invisibility, Whip and Eldritch Blast to make a great defender. If no Whip then use Booming Blade.  You need the Advantage if you plan on being in melee.

* Cha+2: Agonizing Blast multiplies the damage from higher Cha. If you focus on Buffing this may not be as important.

* Alert: Hand out those Buffs on round 1. See if you can get a Sentinel Shield before taking this feat though.

## Level 4

Class: Sorcerer 3 / Hexblade 1

Features: Metamagic(Twin, Quicken), Hexblade curse, Hex Warrior

Spells(Damage, Buff, Utility, Control, Protection, Heal, Defender): 

* Cantrips: **Eldritch Blast****, ****Booming Blade****,**  Minor illusion, Guidance, Mage Hand, Dancing Lights, Poison Spray(Yuan-Ti)

* 1st level: **Hex****, ****Shield**, Sleep, Command, Inflict Wounds, **Healing Word****, ****Suggestion(Yuan-ti)**

Total effective Spell Points: 17 + 2 points per short rest

Equipment: Scale Mail, Shield, Longsword

AC: 18(14+2(dex)+2(shield)), or 23 with Shield spell

### 2nd level spell choice

* Invisibility: world of possibility, Twinning opens even more doors

* Spiritual Weapon: no concentration, synergizes with Hex. Competes with other damage Bonus actions (curse, Hex, Quicken)

* Scorching Ray: best scaling damage on single target damage, works great with curse and Hex

* Dragons Breath: twin this to wreak havoc on lots of mooks. Note: takes an Action to breathe fire, and useful bonus actions are not cheap at these levels. Squishies may not feel comfortable risking their necks for the extra damage.

* Levitate: versatility incarnate. Save allies from a horde. Target hostiles for save-or-die (see below). Almost fly. 

### Layers of Protection

* **18 AC**

* **Shield**

* Magical Resistance: Advantage to saves on spells and anything "magical" is arguably broken

* Poison Immunity: The 2nd most common damage type in the game you ignore

* Favored by the Gods: Use on saves during round 1,2, or when damage is super high

### Defender

* Twin Booming Blade forms the core of our stickiness. 

* Arms of Hadar: Large 25'x25’ area. A failed save means no Opportunity Attacks, making it easier to regroup the team.

* Command/Suggest the enemy commander regroup if your team is being swarmed

### Striker

Hexblade lets us use our Charisma for attacks (no two-handed weapons, but Lance does work if you want to look to get some odd looks from the DM).

#### Long days

With 3 short rests you have 17+8 spell points (liquidating all spell slots) to use over 8 encounters.

* Levitate lasts 10 minutes, long enough to handle a few adjacent rooms.

    * Twin Levitate to protect another squishy

* Hexblade Curse + Eldritch Blast for 1d10+2 force damage, 19-20 crits.

    * This is the last level you can Twin Eldritch Blast.

#### Short day Boss fight

Sadly you can't cast Hex and Inflict wounds on the same turn. Your Eldritch Blast sucks for damage.

Just keep trying to **Levitate** the BBEG (if he's under 500 lbs and Ranged attacks suck), and when you run out of that, **Command** him to Betray/Flee. Recall that Fleeing should use up everything the target has in running, and should take up just as much to get back. Thus at best a failed save should take them out for 2 turns.

Bonus points if their Flee provokes Opportunity Attacks from the Rogue and Fighter.

#### Short day 4-6 equally dangerous foes

1. [Optional] Hexblade curse + Twin Levitate (target non cursed targets)

2. Twin Inflict Wounds (3d10 + 2) + (3d10), Bonus: Convert 1st spell into 2 spell points

3. Twin Inflict Wounds (3d10 + 2) + (3d10)

4. Twin Inflict Wounds (3d10 + 2) + (3d10)

5. Inflict Wounds (3d10 + 2)

6. Long Sword thereafter

7. Allies shoot levitated foes

Averaging 6d10 damage per round @60% to hit = 19.8 DPR, 0.33 KPR + chance to take out 2 foes on round 1.

### Healer

* Lesser Restoration

### Battlefield Control

* Command: See Master of Manipulation above

* Levitate: See Levitate in the Action Economy above

    * Note: If your task is under a minute, cast Mage Hand and Minor Illusion(auditory) before going invisible. You maintain control of the hand and the sound without concentration for 1 minute.

* Suggestion

* Speaks languages of most monolingual races(Giant, Goblin, Draconic)

* Minor Illusion: See Master of Manipulation above

* Command: See Master of Manipulation above

* Mage Hand: See Level 1 above

* Dancing Light: See Level 1 above

### Hex and friends

Hex lets you pick an ability score and make them have disadvantage on those checks (note: not saves).

Because Hex requires your Concentration you can't cast it and one of these other spells, but if an ally does then you can pick 1-2 foes that you want to fail.

The one exception is Minor Illusion, which you have, and is an ability check that foes rarely get any bonuses to at all regardless of level.

#### Str or Dex

* Entangle

* Black tentacles

* Web

    * If it hits (which gets +1d8 damage @ level 5) then the extra 2d8 (**9**) when they move is guaranteed.

    * You get an Opportunity attack on top of this if they dare move. 1d8+3 @ 60% = **+4.5 **expected damage

    * Compare it with a Rogue's Opportunity Attack (1d6+3d6+3) @ 60% to hit = **10.2** expected damage.

    * If the DM allows Marking to gain advantage on the OA then you still beat the Rogue.

* Arms of Hadar: Large 25'x25’ area. A failed save means no Opportunity Attacks, making it easier to regroup the team.

#### Silent Image at-will

Misty Visions(Silent Image at-will): See [The Illusionists Guide to Reality](https://www.enworld.org/threads/the-illusionists-guide-to-reality.652620/) for your new found power. Recall their crappy Intelligence check vs. your proficiency boosted DC applies here as it does to Minor Illusion. Sadly both Silent Image and Hex use your concentration.

#### Long days

Assuming 3 short rests you'll have a total of 50 total effective spell points for the day.

Cast Twin Greater Invisibility/Polymorph/Haste for 4 encounters with 18 spell points left over for other uses.

#### Short day Boss fight

4. Hexblade Curse + Twin Greater Invisibility

5. Quicken Eldritch Blast + Eldritch Blast (6d10+18+24) @88% = 66 DPR, 0.45 KPR

    2. If you are given Advantage from another source, use Hex instead of Quicken for 84 DPR, 0.57 KPR

6. Quicken Hypnotic Pattern + Eldritch Blast (damage allies to wake them if needs be)

7. Quicken Eldritch Blast + Eldritch Blast (6d10+18)

8. ...

### Defender

* Twin Booming Blade still forms the core of our defender offering

    * **With Warcaster we can cast Booming Blade as an Opportunity Attack. This adds 27 damage to the melee attack. Compare this with a rogue's 21 Sneak Attack damage.**

    * **Alternatively go Greater Invisible and use a Whip to cover a large 25'x25’ area where fleeing foes get 3 rays from Eldritch Blast (3d10+9) made with Advantage.  Position yourself so foes trigger an Opportunity Attack when they head to the squishies. 3 rays from a Repelling Eldritch Blast can push them far enough away they run out of movement in the middle of nowhere.**

    * **Hopefully the fear of your blasts keeps foes in place.**

* **Misty Step**: If the squishies get swarmed, teleport behind them and Repelling Eldritch Blast to let them escape.

* Suggest the enemy commander regroup if your team is being swarmed

* [Optional] Staff of the Python: See the defender section above on how this staff fills you out as defender

### **Scout**

* Mage hand for triggering simple traps

* I**nvisible Imp Familiar with Shapechange and Darkvision to scout out boss rooms as a Spider/Rat/Raven, or flying ahead to find ambushes**

* **[Optional] Gloves of Thievery (uncommon, no attunement) +5 to trap checks.**

### Healer

* **Invisible Imp to administer Healing Potions**

* Healing Word

* Lesser Restoration

* Polymorph: See Healing section above for description

* Inspiring Leader**:** See Healer section above

### Battlefield Control

* **Repelling Blast**

    * Quicken Eldritch Blast + Eldritch Blast has the potential to push someone 60' away. Far enough that most would need a dash action to get back. That’s an action not attacking.

    * Synergize with an ally casting an damaging area (Cloudkill, Sleet storm…) Push a bunch of foes back in. Potentially 6 ray are shot independently, so you can get more than 1 into the death zone, thus multiplying the damage/control of each ray.

    * Push a bunch of mooks back into the defender.

* **Imp's Devil’s sight can relay info to your team, like where the foes are.**

* Hypnotic Pattern: AoE locks out multiple foes for the rest of the encounter, if you can keep those that fail from getting woken/damaged.

* Minor Illusion: See Master of Manipulation above

* Levitate: See Levitate in the Action Economy above

### Face

* High Charisma

* Intimidation/Persuasion

* Minor Illusion + Hex for disadvantage vs. investigation checks.

### Out of Combat Utility

* **Locate Object**: Finding the Macguffin, your keys, whatever

* **Misty Step**: Teleportation is handy

* **Invisible Imp**: See Treantmonk's [guide to familiars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLiAzyj5Inc)

## Player Level 15

**See Level 11 Above but with the following changes**

Features: **Metamagic (Silence), Cha+2**

Spells(Damage, Buff, Utility, Control, Protection, Heal, Defender): 

* Cantrips: Eldritch Blast, Booming Blade,  Minor illusion, Guidance, Mage Hand, Dancing Lights, Poison Spray(Yuan-Ti), Message

* 1st level: Hex, Shield, Healing Word, Suggestion(Yuan-ti)

* 2nd level: Lesser Restoration**, **Locate Object, Invisibility, Mirror Image

* 3rd level: Haste, Fireball, Counterspell, Hypnotic Pattern

* 4th level: Greater Invisibility, Polymorph, Divination

* 5th level: **Animate**** ****Objects****, ****Greater Restoration, Heal, Raise Dead**

* 6th level: **Holy Weapon****, ****Chain Lightning**

Note about Holy Weapon: See if your DM will allow Holy Weapon to be Twinned. RAW it shouldn't, but most of the buff spells can. This spell is just flavored to target the weapons rather than the creatures. If DM doesn’t agree, Holy Weapon may still be worth the slot.  You’ll need to pick the right round to blow the radiant AoE to maximize the effects. The damage is great vs. single target. The AoE is great vs a horde which are blind thanks to you.

Note about Chain Lighting and dropping our AoE: You still have Hypnotic Pattern and your higher level slots at this level aren't as in demand as your spell points in general. Chain Lightning scales the best in the game +10d6 for getting another target per level upcast.

Healer

* Heal: I prefer Polymorph as it heals more HP, however Heal doesn't take concentration and can be twinned in an emergency. Swap out for whatever utility your team needs.

* Raise Dead: Only get this if a Bard/Cleric can't. You’re known spells are thinly spread as it is.

* Greater Restoration: Don't forget to twin this when the team gets slammed with these conditions.

# Sample Backstory

======

Yuan-ti are typically viewed as the cliche evil guys, evil motives, evil tactics, evil past and free pass to slaughter every last one of them. But I'd like to show them from a different light.

## Quiddity and Choice

Order of the Stick [did a great job](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots1141.html) showing the relationship between a god's essence and his followers. Now imagine if one of the early gods revealed, or had the key to quiddity understood by mere mortals. Further imagine if this essence was rooted in Choice. The greater the ability to choose, the greater the quiddity added to a god when that being died and rendered to that god's realm. Now imagine if you could somehow consume the quiddity from a creature and add it to your own. Animal sacrifices and human sacrifices now make sense as a mechanism for gaining power and ultimately consuming one's own god in order to supplant them, a sort of survial of the fittest.

This would explain their lack of empathy for humans, as no one but the Yuan-ti have learned the rituals for consuming choice. This explains why mind control and magical resistance is so common as they are striving to become creatures that have greater will than others. This explains why they are unique in using their gods as tools and think some capable of replacing them.

Rather than playing a Yuan-ti that is neutral evil for evil's sake, you can play one that looks at life differently. You use illusion as a way to test a person's fitness of Choice. You use Command as a way to take their choice or respect them when they assert their will and get a glimpse of what true living is.

## Background

My first kiss was to the mayor of a town I had seduced and killed. Our clan needed to incite a civil war to weaken them so I posed as a citizen of a neighboring town. I learned a great deal of what human men liked.

This earned me the right to pursue Sorcery. I read about the epic empire we once had and the power Merrshaulk offered our people and wanted to see his might restored. Yet because I was a female I was barred from the priesthood. I mixed sorcery and divine to become a Divine Soul.

## Ideals

I seek to awaken Merrshaulk, or better yet be powerful enough to consume and supplant him.

## Bonds

High priests of Merrshaulk are likely to take notice of me as I gain in power, some wanting to sacrifice me, others fearing I will reveal disruptive truths (see below).

## Goals

* Fly in an airship. Being pressed upon by the Jungle Canopy and humidity, I've fantasized about the flying ships I read in the history books of my people from thousands of years ago.

* I'm on a quest to become a warlock and use it’s curse combined with the sacrificial rites of Merrshaulk in order to better attune my mind to his and awaken Merrshaulk. I've learned that kidnapping people is a poor way to get sacrifices, instead society allows me to kill bad guys. Either way works.

* <Reflavor Hexblade's curse to reflect Yaun-ti’s belief that killing/sacrifice bestows power. See the on-death trigger of the curse>

* Research a rumor there is a stick that can be transformed into a gloriously large snake, and how to control it. Perhaps the long forgotten spell "Sticks to Snakes" was simply misremembered.

## Flaws

* I am unprepared to deal with my humanity leaking through. Humor will at first be simply another learned skill, but slowly I'll finally start actually getting it. Similarly crying will change from activated to real sorrow. I try to suppress this through meditation but humanity perseveres. Will this humanity drive me to fight Mershaulk’s cult, or will I be able to successfully supplant him?

* My forked tongue is both a blessing and a curse. People recoil when they see it. Yet it is helpful in pronouncing foreign tongues and in seducing men and smelling pheromones. Thus when others lie they are less effective when they are nervous. Being attracted and in fear are easily exploited. Cities give me a headache unless I literally keep my mouth shut.

## Interactions with others

As a humans look at Horses as tools, but categorically inferior to them, so do I view myself as a cut above humans. Some call me a racist, but if they only knew of the potential power they rarely glimpse when they chose to let their will overpower their bestial nature. I respect those that, through sheer will, defy the odds and rise above the dust of the earth. The Yuan-ti are the only people strong enough to take Quiddity from another and thus challenge the gods. I've learned that people are uncomfortable with these views, so I quietly let them continue in their meaningless lives and mortal visions.

## Plot Hook

Powerful high priest of Mershaulk notice my rise to power and seek to kill me. When I learn about the prison(see below) and the futility of it all, their leadership seeks to kill me to keep the truth and their priestcraft hidden.

## Plot Twist

The other Serpent gods, Sseth and later Set, unable to kill Merrshaulk, create a prison forever squelching his ability to communicate with his followers (incidentally triggering the downfall of the Yaun-ti). As is common in Yaun-ti culture, powerful high priests seek to consume their god and replace him. But with the prison it instead sucks in those that get that far and one kills the other with the prison draining their Quiddity to fuel the religion. Have others come to understand the prison as well as I do? Should I seek to destroy the prison and replace him, or choose to crush the head of the religion and let the last of the Quiddity be drained away and end the cycle of futility?
